# Gatsby Starter Sanity Base
A monorepo for starting a gatsby and sanity project using lerna. 

__Note:__ This starter is recommended for those familiar with using Sanity and Gatsby and would like a "clean" project to start with. I would suggest using their [official starter](https://github.com/sanity-io/example-company-website-gatsby-sanity-combo) where this project was based on, if you want to see the full power of Sanity.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/daydream05/gatsby-starter-sanity-base.git
cd gatsby-starter-sanity-base
npm install

# Install or upgrade the Sanity CLI to
# make sure you are on v0.140.0 or higher
npm install -g @sanity/cli
# Set up Sanity.io account and project (â‰ˆ 45s)
npm run init
```
